    Bill and Rhonda DeSpain met in high school and have been together ever
    since; celebrating their 40th wedding anniversary July 29th of 2018. Rhonda
    recognized early in their relationship that Bill was a self-starter and had
    the determination to be an entrepreneur. Bill describes Rhonda as someone
    with great patience and understanding of others; perfect attributes when
    working with employees and focused on serving customers. Together they
    raised two sons and built a company with a strong reputation as a place
    people like to work for and customers like to purchase from.

    Bill DeSpain had worked in the sealing industry for over 17 years. When his
    father-in-law sold his company ‘American Seal’, Bill decided to change
    career direction and moved into real estate. Bill fully emerged himself in
    his new career but former customers and industry friends kept suggesting
    that the market in Houston could really use another quality sealing
    distributor. After doing his due diligence, Bill believed the opportunity
    was feasible. After some initial hesitation, Rhonda gave her concurrence and
    became an active partner, the two of them launched Global O-Ring and Seal in
    February 2008.

    Opening a new business is never easy and without challenges. At some point
    along that journey, a company reaches a critical milestone where the
    aspirations become a viable business. Through the very hard work of Bill and
    Rhonda and the entire Global O-Ring team, the accumulation of numerous small
    steps resulted in hitting a number of key milestones. At the end of their
    third fiscal year, the business had reached a point where aspiration was a
    reality and now they were moving their attention to introducing new products
    and pursuing a broader geographical reach.

    In April 2012, Bill and Rhonda welcomed the addition of their son Brian to
    the business. This was when they knew the business would live long into the
    future. Prior to joining Global O-Ring, Brian sharpened his entrepreneurial
    skills by starting his own successful business in athletic equipment. Brian
    moved to China to work closely with his manufacturers to ensure the highest
    quality product. Brian graduated from Texas A&M University with a degree in
    Business Management. Brian is the 3rd-generation in his family to enter the
    sealing industry.
